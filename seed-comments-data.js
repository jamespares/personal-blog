But I'd push back slightly - the BRI does come with strings attached, they're just less visible. Chinese companies often bring their own workers and the contracts can be pretty opaque. It's not colonialism but it's not purely benign either."

Mandarin is tonal and uses characters - its just not going to replace english for international business anytime soon. The bigger question is whether the UK can leverage its linguistic advantage better post-Brexit."

Dan Wang's newsletter Breakneck also had a good piece about how BRI projects are performing in practice. A lot of them have actually underdelivered which complicates the neocolonialism narrative."

The push for personalised learning has good intentions but in practice it often means kids sat in silence on chromebooks. The best learning I see happens when the whole class is engaged in discussion together. You cant replicate that with an algorithm."

These groups are expensive to treat and insurance models tend to underserve them."
