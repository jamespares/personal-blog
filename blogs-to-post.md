1. Belt and Road - How is it different from British Colonialism? Why is UK shrinking from the world while China is expanding? How will this affect the prevalence of English as the global language?
2. UK and China Trade relationship - what could the UK gain by engaging more with China? What are the risks? Cheaper EVs, cheaper goods, but at what cost? 
3. Education - is personalised learning always a good thing if it leads to a less cohesive classroom? More personalisation means students are all learning different things, which could lead to less social cohesion. 
4. Politics - divide and multiply - how capitalism divides people to increase the needs/wants of individual consumers and maximise consumer spending. Consumers with closer social bonds are less likely to spend money on consumer goods, as they are more likely to be content with what they have or to share - is this a fair assumption? Or do social bonds actually encourage more spending due to in-group materialism and competitive consumption?
5. Education - a new model for learning in the age of HW - in-class work should be pen and paper and speaking and presenting to build social skills; at home work should be personalised HW on laptops/tablets, this could be AI-generated to be perfectly tailored to each student's needs and abilities, and scores should be marked and tracked rigorously by AI, with teachers receiving detailed scores on home learnining to help guide the in-class teaching and activities. Tools like the Nuwa Pen could ensure that students written notes are automatically saved in a cloud for review when they get home.
6. Politics - immigration is great. but too much immigration seprates people and causes cultural breakdown. immigration should be managed closely and should ideally only come from similar cultures with shared geopolitical interests. 
7. Politics - NHS - the NHS should become an insurance based system paid for by employers, with a basic level of coverage for all citizens, and the option to purchase additional coverage for more comprehensive care. This would create a more competitive market, which would lead to better quality care and lower costs. Users should pay a subsidised rate at the point of care which is reimbursed by their employer via a health insurance spending card. hospitals are given bonuses based on the wuality of the care recevied and the amount they are earning - this creates competition and encourages efficiency and quality.
